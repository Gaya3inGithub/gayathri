    <h2>Hello Everyone!</h2>
    <p>
        I am Gayathri Thangavelraj, a recent Java Full Stack Developer with 4 months of intensive training. I have hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end development and am eager to apply my skills to real-world projects. I have developed a strong foundation in programming, with proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, MySQL, and Git.
    </p>

        I have successfully completed several projects, including the development of the Parent Linker system, an IoT-based anti-theft flooring system, and more. I am a quick learner, ready to take on new challenges, and driven to continually improve my skill set.
